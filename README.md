# Apollo-Scooters

This project consists of two parts. The first part, implementing the Bluetooth device search, can be found on the "Home" tab. To search for nearby devices, tap on the "Scan" button. The second part of the project involves implementing a pixel-perfect design from Figma, which can be found on the "Store" tab. The Snapkit third-party library was used for the layout, and although there are some warnings related to constraints, they are easily fixable. The project contains no errors.
